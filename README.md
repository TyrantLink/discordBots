# discordBots
this is just a repository for my discord bots because I can.

I use semicolons fuck you.

use the [newest](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100a6/) version of python because match case. tested as far back as a6

also pylint just doesn't work because it doesn't like match case yet.
