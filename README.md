# discordBots
this is just a repository for my discord bots because I can.

I use semicolons fuck you.

you'll need python 3.10a6 minimum or which ever version added match case.

known issues:

    VSCode always has error "<class 'AttributeError'>: 'TreeRebuilder' object has no attribute 'visit_match'" because the debugger doesn't like using match case.
